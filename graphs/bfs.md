**Breadth First Search**
* a fundamental seearch algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph.
* It runs with a time complexity of O(V+E)
* used as a building block for other algoirthms
* useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted graphs
* A BFS starts at some arbitrary node of a graph and exploreese neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
* It makes a queue of which node it should visit next
* the bfs algorithm uses a queue data structure to track which node to visit next.
