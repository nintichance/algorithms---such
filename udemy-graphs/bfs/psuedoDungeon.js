//Global VARS needed

// num of rows & cols
// input matrix
// starting row and col
// queue for rows and cols

// VARS used to track the num of steps taken

// moveCount tracks steps taken
// nodesLeftInLayer tracks how many nodes we need to dequeue before taking a step
// nodesInNextLayer tracks the nodes we will traverse in the next step

// VAR used to tracker wheether the 'E' character
// ever gets reached during the BFS

// reachedEnd = false

// R X C matrix of false values used to track
// whether the node at position (i, j) has been visited

// visited

// North, south, east, west direction vectors

// dr =  [-1, +1, 0, 0]
// dc =  [0, 0, -1, +1]
